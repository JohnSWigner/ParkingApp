# ParkingApp
# 
# ParkingApp is intended to be a rudimentary parking system that allows a client (Android app) to connect to a server, which will act as a
# middleman between the client and a number of parking sensors. For demonstration purposes, I created testServer.java which will create
# "dummy" data that simulates output from parking sensors. 
#
# Included should be everything necessary to build and run the app within Android Studio, or some other Android emulator/device.
